# Inauguration Tweets Visualized

Just a quick little visualization of how people are feeling about the recent inauguration of president Donald Trump. Almost finished over PennApps 2017. This was my first time working with the twitter API and d3, so I'm pretty happy with how this turned out. The NLP of the tweets isn't very viable at all given the angry nature on both sides and the relatively small sample size. Might go back and try to polish this up sometime later, but probably not, there just weren't enough geotagged tweets.

Most of the code is pretty scripty as I was rushing to complete it. The interactive web version only works on an http server. Python and node both supply one that should be really easy to start up.
